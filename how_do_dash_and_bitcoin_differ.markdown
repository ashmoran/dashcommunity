# How does Dash differ from Bitcoin?

Dash is a [fork][fork-wikipedia] of Bitcoin. This means that it is based on the same original code as Bitcoin, with improvements and additions made since. You can think of it a bit like a car, which has had new seats, a new exhaust, and new bodywork. So if you already know how Bitcoin works (or what the original car was like), you can understand Dash by looking at the changes that have been applied (or what work has been done to the car).

## History

Bitcoin was introduced in January 2009 by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto (source: [Bitcoin Wikipedia page][bitcoin-wikipedia]). Dash was introduced in January 2014 by nonymous developer Evan Duffield (source: [Dash wikipedia page][dash-wikipedia]).

## Blockchain

Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a blockchain. Blocks are created on average every 10 minutes, and have a maximum size of 1MB. Dash blocks are created on average every 2.5 minutes. They currently also have a limit of 1MB, which gives Dash 4x the maximum transaction throughput of Bitcoin. The Dash masternode network (masternodes are explained below) has voted to [increase the blocksize limit to 2MB][dash-2mb-proposal] if necessary.

Currently (2016-11-09), Bitcoin is running at capacity and typically has a backlog of several thousand transactions, and has a backlog of several thousand transactions (see [BitcoinQueue.com][bitcoinqueue]). Dash is running far under capacity and has no transaction queue.

## Mining

Blocks in both Bitcoin and Dash are generated by [proof-of-work][pow] mining. The PoW algorithm for Bitcoin is [SHA-256][sha-256], for Dash it is [X11][x11].

## Nodes

Both Bitcoin and Dash run on a network of [peer-to-peer][p2p] nodes which relay transactions and validate the blockchain as transactions are confirmed. In Bitcoin, all nodes are equal. There is no cost to running a Bitcoin node beyond the hardware, electricity, and time required to keep it operational.

Dash has two types of node. A standard Dash node serves the same purposes as a Bitcoin node, relaying transactions and validating the blockchain. Dash also has *masternodes*. Masternodes perform all the same services as standard nodes, and also provide Dash-specific services. To operate a masternode, the owner must hold 1000 DASH in a single transaction output as a proof of stake in the Dash network. (Dash does *not* use a proof-of-stake system to secure the blockchain, only to prevent [Sybil attacks][sybil-attack] on the masternode network).

Masternodes support the following services on the Dash network, which are unique to Dash and not found in Bitcoin:

* InstandSend – instant transaction confirmation
* PrivateSend – pre-mixing of DASH currency to improve
* The Dash Treasury – a portion of the block reward which is spent on Dash development proposals

These features are explained below.
